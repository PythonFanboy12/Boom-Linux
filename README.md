# Boom-Linux
Work-in-progress, easy-to-install Linux distro

# Welcome
Boom! Linux is meant to be easy to install and use. When I release Boom, there'll be install instructions. For now, I can tell you about what you'll hopefully get in my first release of Boom Linux.

Boom Linux will have a desktop manager of your choice! Yup, you don't have to feel restricted to the limited options that other distros like Ubuntu give you on install, like GNOME. Boom Linux is supposed to be e x t r e m e l y bare-bones, as in Arch-level. NOW, if you do want some fun things, like xsnow(for modern distros), then you'll have to install those manually. As I said, Boom is extremely bare-bones, so many things you would find in Ubuntu or Mint will not be there. Okay, if you've read this far, good on you, you must be excited for this! Or you have nothing else to do. It's probably not the latter. Hopefully.

# Why is it called Boom! Linux? Why shouldn't I install Arch instead?

Boom Linux is called Boom because the install process is easy and fast, similar to a BOOM! As for the second question, A, You can install Arch if you want. It just won't be as easy to install. Boom is meant for beginners who still want to customize their distro, but don't want the scary text-based installer that Arch still uses.

# Thank you! ❤️

Thank you so much for looking at Boom Linux! I'm so glad you came to look at my project. This distro is Unlicenced.
