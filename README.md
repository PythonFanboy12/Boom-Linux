# About Boom!

Boom! Linux is set to release in December 2025, and will be free and open-source. I expect Boom! to run on older 32-bit and 64-bit platforms, due to it's simplicity and lack of bloatware. Boom! is meant to be a "beginner" type of distro, with all the customizability of Arch. Think Xubuntu, but less bloated. Last thing, Boom! is open-source and is licensed using the Unlicence Licence. Feel free to modify it in any way to suit your Linux-y needs!
